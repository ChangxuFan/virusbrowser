      <description>The WashU Virus Genome Browser is a publicly available resource for efficient visualization of viral sequencing data. In response to SARS-CoV-2’s rapid global spread and resulting pandemic health crisis, research efforts have been underway sequencing the 29 kb virus genome and transcriptome, mapping RNA-seq modifications, and predicting locations of antigenic peptide sequences, providing the research community with an abundance of data resources to better understand the virus’s pathology. As these data become available to the public, they are being integrated into the WashU Virus Genome Browser platform.</description>
